# Project-2---Automated-Analysis

## Overview
**Project-2---Automated-Analysis** is a data analysis tool that automatically processes datasets, generates insights, and visualizes the results. The project is designed to handle a variety of datasets and produce in-depth reports, including statistical summaries, correlation analysis, and relevant visualizations. The tool uses Python and integrates with OpenAI's models to generate narrative insights based on the data.

## Datasets Analyzed
The following datasets are analyzed in this project:
- **Goodreads Dataset**: Analysis of books, ratings, authors, and genres.
- **Media Dataset**: Media views, ratings, and genres analysis.
- **Happiness Dataset**: Analysis of happiness scores, income, education, and social support by country.

## Features
- **Automatic Data Loading**: Upload a dataset, and the system will load and analyze it.
- **Summary Statistics**: Automatically generates statistical summaries for numerical and categorical columns.
- **Visualizations**: Correlation heatmaps, distribution plots, and other insightful visualizations are generated and saved.
- **Narrative Generation**: Using OpenAI’s API, the system creates a detailed narrative based on the analysis results.
